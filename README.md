# asteroids-sketching-demo
Direct port of https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/asteroids/ to the racket [#lang sketching](https://soegaard.github.io/sketching/index.html)

Trying out #lang sketching since using Racket like Processing has been something I always wanted to do. However I was learning game programming stuff, so I used it like Love2d instead. It works pretty well for that too, actually. Runs pretty smoothly and you can use dot notation to access struct members!
